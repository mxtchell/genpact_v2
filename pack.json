Berlin is forecast to receive up to 120 mm (4.7\") of rain in a 24-hour period, particularly on Friday. Budapest and Warsaw could experience quarter-sized hail and minor tornado activity.\n\n**Impacts:**\n\n- Urban flooding and transport disruption in major cities, including railway and airport delays.\n- Possible power outages due to downed trees and lines.\n- Localized agricultural damage, especially to ripening crops.\n- Evacuation orders likely along riverbanks in Dresden and Krak\u00f3w.\n\n**Advisory:** Secure outdoor objects, avoid unnecessary travel, and monitor alerts from local meteorological services.\n\n## Mediterranean Basin: Wildfire and Wind Threats\n\nThe Mediterranean coastline\u2014including southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus\u2014faces a critical wildfire risk as temperatures climb above 42\u00b0C with humidity dipping below 15%. Strong Mistral and Bora winds will accelerate fire spread. Athens is under a red alert for both fire and air quality, with particulate pollution rising from regional smoke plumes.\n\n**Impacts:**\n\n- Evacuations underway in forested suburbs near Rome and Athens.\n- Major highways closed due to poor visibility and fire proximity.\n- Maritime warnings for small craft across the Aegean and Adriatic Seas.\nEND OF PAGE: 3",

Rainfall deficits exceed 65% of normal in the Maghreb. Daytime temperatures between 38\u201344\u00b0C aggravate water scarcity, and dust storms (\u201chaboobs\u201d) are forecast for Algeria and eastern Libya, significantly reducing visibility.\n\n**Impacts:**\n\n- Severe water restrictions in Casablanca, Tunis, and Tripoli.\n- Reduced crop yields forecast for wheat and olive growers.\n- Transport delays due to sand accumulation on major roadways and airports.\n\nAdvisory: Limit outdoor exposure during dust storms, and follow updates from health authorities regarding water consumption.\n\n# West Africa: Flooding Risk\n\nThe Niger, Senegal, and Ghana river basins face extreme rainfall events, with accumulations up to 250 mm (10\u201d) over 72 hours. The city of Bamako, Mali, has already reported urban flooding, with more expected along the Niger River. Lagos, Nigeria, is on alert for flash floods due to blocked drainage and high tides.\n\n**Impacts:**\n\n- Displacement of vulnerable communities in low-lying areas.\n- Damage to housing, infrastructure, and croplands.\n- Increased risk of waterborne diseases, including cholera outbreaks in affected zones.\n\nAdvisory: Relocate to higher ground if issued evacuation orders, boil drinking water, and avoid wading through floodwaters.\n\n# Middle East: Sandstorms and Scorching Heat\n\nSaudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, and the UAE can expect a series of intense sandstorms, locally referred to as \u201csharav\u201d or \u201ckhamsin,\u201d reducing visibility below 300 meters in some desert corridors. Meanwhile, cities such as Riyadh, Baghdad, and Dubai will see temperatures surge to 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F), challenging infrastructure and daily routines. Urban flooding from brief but intense storm cells is expected in Tel Aviv and Amman due to insufficient drainage systems.\n\n\nEND OF PAGE: 4",

The storm, named Cyclone Zahra, is expected to make landfall near Mombasa on Saturday, bringing sustained winds of 140 km/h (87 mph) and rainfall totals exceeding 200 mm (8\u201d) within 36 hours.\n\n| Region                  | Wind Speed (km/h) | Rainfall (mm) | Impact                          |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| Mombasa, Kenya          | 140               | 200+          | Flooding, infrastructure damage |\n| Dar es Salaam, Tanzania | 120               | 180           | Landslides, port closures       |\n\n\n**Impacts:**\n\n- Major flooding in urban and rural areas.\n- Risk of landslides on saturated hillsides and coastal cliffs.\n- Port closures and suspension of ferry services along the Swahili Coast.\n\n**Advisory:** Move to secure shelters, avoid travel, and heed all civil defense instructions.\n\n## Major City Spotlights\n\n| City             | Conditions                    | High Temp (\u00b0C) | Special Risk       |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |\n| London, UK       | Mild, chance of thunderstorms | 25             | Transport delays   |\n| Cairo, Egypt     | Drought, dust storms          | 42             | Water scarcity     |\n| Paris, France    | Extreme heatwave              | 40             | Health risk        |\n| Istanbul, Turkey | Dry, windy                    | 38             | Fire risk          |\n| Lagos, Nigeria   | Flood risk, heavy rain        | 33             | Urban flooding     |\n| Dubai, UAE       | Sandstorms, extreme heat      | 49             | Airport disruption |\n\n\n\nEND OF PAGE: 5",

The IMA will continue to monitor developments and provide updates as necessary.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe EMEA region is bracing for a week of severe and extreme weather. From historic heatwaves in Southern Europe and the Middle East to dangerous floods in West and East Africa, the potential for widespread impacts is significant. Residents are urged to take all precautions, monitor official channels, and prioritize safety above all.\n\nStay tuned for further bulletins, and refer to your local authorities for the latest warnings and emergency instructions.\nEND OF PAGE: 6",
